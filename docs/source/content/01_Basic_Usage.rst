4D-BioReconX
--------------

**4D-BioReconX** is a scalable and versatile framework designed to construct a comprehensive four-dimensional (4D) spatial transcriptomics atlas of whole animals at single-cell resolution. This approach enables us to track the intricate spatiotemporal dependencies of morphogenetic gradients and regenerative patterning. It runs based on spatial transcriptomics data, such as Stereo-seq (spatial enhanced resolution omics sequencing) data. Notably, we are still working on the improvement of performance and calculation efficiency.
