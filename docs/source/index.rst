4D-BioReconX
========================================================
.. rubric:: a bioinformatic framework for reconstructing 4D spatial transcriptomics atlas and spatiotemporal analyses+

**4D-BioReconX** is a scalable and versatile framework designed to construct a comprehensive four-dimensional (4D) spatial transcriptomics atlas of whole animals at single-cell resolution. \
This approach enables us to track the intricate spatiotemporal dependencies of morphogenetic gradients and regenerative patterning. \
It runs based on spatial transcriptomics data, such as Stereo-seq (spatial enhanced resolution omics sequencing) data. \
Notably, we are still working on the improvement of performance and calculation efficiency.


* Get quickly started by browsing :ref:`/content/00_Installation.rst`, :ref:`/content/01_Basic_Usage.rst` or :ref:`/tutorials/index.rst`.
* Use our planarian manuscript workflow by following :ref:`/planarianmanuscript/index.rst`.
* Open to discuss and provide feedback on `Github <https://github.com/BGI-Qingdao/4D-BioReconX>`_.


Highlights
------------

* To our knowledge, this represents the first framework for achieving single-cell resolved, four-dimensional (4D) transcriptional and anatomical reconstruction of adult animals at the molecular level. Leveraging Stereo-seq, we meticulously profiled
* Our analysis models the spatiotemporal reprogramming of positional information during regeneration. We unveil genes responding to regeneration with
* We identified a Regeneration-Organizing Domain (ROD) and the underlying regulatory mechanisms. While organizers in development are known to establish
